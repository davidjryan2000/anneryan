								<h4 class="media-heading">What is CBT?</h4>
								<p>CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) is a collaborative, practical and problem-focussed approach to personal problems whereby both the client and therapist work together towards understanding problems in terms of the relationship between thoughts, feelings and behaviour. The more actively involved the client is in this goal-orientated process, the better the outcome. Treatment is often action-orientated, with specific technique-driven, brief, direct and time-limited exercises for specific psychological disorders. .</p>

								<h4 class="media-heading">What is Therapy?</h4>
								<p>Therapy is time set aside by you and the therapist to explore what has brought you to therapy. This might include talking about life events (both past and present), feelings, conscious worries, relationships, ways of thinking or patterns of behaviour. The therapist will help you to develop a clearer and deeper understanding of your situation, and to identify the appropriate course of action for you – either to help you resolve your difficulties or find better ways of coping.

								<h4 class="media-heading">What is Counselling and Psychotherapy?</h4>
								<p>LSome people use the terms “counselling” and “psychotherapy” inter-changeably. While there is considerable overlap between the two, there are important differences. The therapist will want to be sure that what they offer is appropriate to you before there is any commitment and he/she will be happy to explain his/her approach. “Counselling” is a relatively short-term process which is suitable when your main focus is the resolution of a particular difficulty or situation affecting you in the present. Some examples are: bereavement, coping with a significant life change life eg: redundancy or the end of a relationship, a bullying situation or work problem, anger issues. “Psychotherapy” is a longer process which helps you understand the deeper roots of a problematic situation which is more generalised, in order to develop broader and deeper resourcefulness within yourself. Some examples include: generalised or specific anxiety, depression, relationship problems, low self esteem which is long established, eating distress, addiction or unresolved trauma. Both counselling and psychotherapy involve a contractual arrangement in which a therapist meets a client, in privacy and in confidence, to deal with the distress that has brought the individual into therapy and help you to find ways to live your life more fully and to experience greater freedom and self acceptance.</p>

								<h4 class="media-heading">How long is each session?</h4>
								<p>Each session will be about 50 minutes. How long you may have to continue attending depends on many factors ie: the nature and depth of the issue which brings you to therapy, the type of outcome you desire, your own willingness and motivation to change etc. In other words, each client’s situation is unique. The therapist will be happy to discuss this with you in the first session and will be happy to agree to review and evaluate with you on a regular basis in relation to this and any other issue. Most therapists will suggest an initial number of sessions, usually six. This will enable the therapist to get to know you and your circumstances in more detail and give you an opportunity to become more relaxed and more open in talking about your difficulties in therapy.</p>

								<h4 class="media-heading">Cancellation or change of Appointment Policy</h4>
								<p>Your appointment is your time and space to speak to your therapist. Therefore, it is important that if you cannot attend you provide sufficient notice of cancellation, as it becomes difficult to schedule another client. A minimum of one week’s notice is required in order to cancel a session. If less than a week is given, the fee for the cancelled session will be payable. Your therapist will give you detailed information about cancellation arrangements in your first session.  Occasionally, it might be possible to reschedule a session to the day before or after the appointed day (where the client has not been in a position to give one week’s notice). However, this is subject to the availability of appointment times. If the session cannot be accommodated then the cancellation fee will be payable..</p>
