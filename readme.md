 # Stream 1 Project, Code Institute - David Ryan

# Introduction 
This project was used to build a website for a psychotherapist.  It's a responsive static site based on a the Company theme from bootstrapmade (https://bootstrapmade.com/company-free-html-bootstrap-template/). The site is built using HTML5 CSS and JS along with jQuery and Bootstrap.

The html pages were redesigned to suit the purposes of the project.  The Navbar was reduced and altered to reflect the apps new purpose. CSS elements were retained largely on the pages although colours and sections were changed. The clients contact phone number was added to the breadcrumb beneatth the navbar so potential clients can find it easily on each page. A new hero image was added including important text and contact number specified by the client. Old template images removed. Information was received from the client relating to the counselling work involved.  This is spread throughout the website.  A video explaining CBT was embedded beside a paragraph explaining how Counselling works. This is to improve the user experience. A services section was added to the homepage to identify the different target audiences. A testimonial section was added to support the standard on the service along with the logos of the different organisations the pschotherapist is involved with in order to imporve credibility. The footer has links to social media which is not active yet.  I've left them in as I'm still working with the client to create her web presence and once the accounts are ready the links will be created.

The About Page
This page contains information about the client. It's purpose is to allow potential customers to research the interests an qualifications of the therapist.  I'm awaiting a better photograph from the client as the current one lacks impact.A twitter feed from InspirationDay was added to add some daily inspiration for users.  Tweets on the feed were reduced to 3 only as the feed was too long.  The feed updates once new tweets made.

The FAQ Page
This page was created to address questions that may arise from potential users of the service.  Research was done into similiar service providers to determine the most common FAQ's. These were then agreed with the client.

The Resources Page
I added a selection of videos relating to the areas that the client works in. A filter was also added so site users can select videos of interest with ease. The video layout is responsive, although it took some work to get the sizing and layout correct to allow the text description to sit neatly beneath.  The client was very happy with this section and would like to expand the range of resouces over time.  

The Contact Page

The Google map in the theme was changed to the location of the clients office.  The map will resize on different screens once loaded but resizing the window in will change the current centre postion of the map. I've left in the contact form at the clients request - there is no backend requirement for the stream 1 project but to complete the work for the client I'll create one and activate the contact form. A Javascript message will appear once the form is completed and the submit button is clicked. An autoplay audio track was added to this form. It is not required for the clients purposes but demonstrates what can be achieved with audio tags.
